libev-sharp is a wrapper around the libev ( http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html ) library.

Currently the only supported operations are:
 * IOWatcher - A wrapper around ev_io for watching IO operations
 * TimerWatcher -  A wrapper around ev_timer for creating timers
 * PrepareWatcher - A wrapper around ev_prepare, will be called before each blocking wait call
 * CheckWatcher - A wrapper around ev_check, will be called after each blocking wait call.

Also, nested loops are not supported.  You can only create and operate on the default loop.

This project is mainly meant to be used by the Manos project ( http://github.com/jacksonh/manos ) so likely will not be fully productized with documentation, tests, examples, ect, unless there is a need.

TODO:
 * Watchers will need to be gchandled so they don't disappear while waiting for events.
